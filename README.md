project 3 Peer Review
Reviewer 1
I did not find any errors with the code writing. The code ran as intended. Instead of using buttons the person could have linked the two windows together using tabs with a tabgroup comment. I found it is easier using tabs to link everything together. The titles on the button could also be more clear on what the user is actually clicking to go to. The user added the camera gadget code. The code runs as intended and looks identical to the book code.
